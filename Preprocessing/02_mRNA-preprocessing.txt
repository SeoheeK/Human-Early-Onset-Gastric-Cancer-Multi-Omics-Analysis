# RNA-seq Preprocessing

The .sra files were subjected to fasterq-dump using SRA Toolkit (v3.0.7). Trimming of adapters and removal of low-quality sequences were executed with Trimmomatic (v0.39)9). Transcriptome alignment was performed utilizing STAR (v2.7.11a)10), employing a genome index generated from the GRCh38 (Human) sequence. Finally, quantification of mRNA reads was achieved using RSEM (v1.3.3)11).
