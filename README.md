# Human-Early-Onset-Gastric-Cancer-Multi-Omics-Analysis

## Abstrack
 Multi-omics analysis involves the comprehensive and integrated examination of diverse molecular data. Compared to single-omics analysis, multi-omics analysis encompasses larger datasets encompassing diverse molecular levels, thus providing better insights into studying diseases such as cancer, and can make substantial contributions to diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.
 
 The incidence of gastric cancer (GC) has significantly decreased in recent decades. Nonetheless, there has been evidence of a slightly increasing trend in young adults. Approximately 5.0% of GC patients diagnosed before the age of 40 have been reported. Despite this, there have been relatively few genome-wide studies on this population. An unmet need exists for molecular signatures that can be utilized in the diagnosis and therapy of this type of diffuse gastric cancers. 
 
 Therefore, In this study, we pre-processed molecular data from 80 young GC patients and performed proteogenomics analyses to obtain additional insights on the disease. All procedures were referred from previous analyses.

## Project Purpose
### 01 Pre-processing of WES, RNA-seq, proteomics data
  The primary objective of this project is to download datasets of whole exome sequencing, mRNA sequencing, and proteomics data of 80 early-onset gastric cancer patients available in the publication5) and process them into analytically usable data.

### 02 Conducting Proteogenomic analyses
  Perform proteogenomic analysis including correlation between each type of data and clustering using the processed data, aiming to discover significant molecular signatures.
